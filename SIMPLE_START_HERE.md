# 🚀 Simple Guide: What To Do Next
## COMFYpri¢e - HVAC Ballpark Estimator

**You've built an app! Now what?**

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture (In Simple Terms)

You built a website that helps people get HVAC estimates. Right now:
- ✅ It works on your computer
- ✅ People can fill out forms
- ✅ It gives them price estimates
- ❌ But it's NOT on the internet yet (only you can see it)

**Your goal:** Put it on the internet so other people can use it.

## 📋 Step-by-Step: What To Do

### STEP 1: Test It On Your Computer (5 minutes)

3. Ask them what they think
4. Collect their feedback

**What to ask them:**
- "Was it easy to use?"
